# AI Video Generator - Original Content (VEED + Claude)

## Overview

This n8n workflow automatically generates **TikTok/Reels-ready talking head videos** from scratch. You provide a topic and intention, and the workflow handles everything: scriptwriting, avatar generation, voiceover creation, and video rendering.

**Output**: Vertical (9:16) AI-generated videos with lip-synced avatars, ready for social media posting.

## What It Does

```
Topic + Intention → Claude writes script → OpenAI generates avatar → OpenAI creates voiceover → VEED renders video → Saved to Google Drive + logged to Sheets
```

### Pipeline Breakdown

## Custom Avatar & Script Options

The workflow supports flexible content generation - you can let Claude generate everything, or provide your own inputs.

### Custom Avatar Description

Leave `custom_avatar_description` empty to let Claude decide, or provide your own:

```json
"custom_avatar_description": "a female influencer in her 30s, with a coworking space in the background, attractive but charismatic"
```

**Examples:**
- `"a woman in her 20s with gym clothes"`
- `"a bearded man in his 30s wearing a hoodie"`
- `"a professional woman with glasses in business casual"`

### Custom Script

Leave `custom_script` empty to let Claude write it, or provide your own:

```json
"custom_script": "This is my custom script. VEED is a great platform for creating videos like this. You can try it too!"
```

**Guidelines for custom scripts:**
- Keep it 30-45 seconds when read aloud
- Maximum ~450 characters
- Avoid special characters for TTS compatibility
- Write naturally, as if speaking

### Behavior Matrix

| custom_avatar_description | custom_script | What Claude Generates |
|---------------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Empty | Empty | Avatar + Script + Caption |
| Provided | Empty | Script + Caption |
| Empty | Provided | Avatar + Caption |
| Provided | Provided | Caption only |

## Content Angles (auto-rotated)

When generating multiple videos, the workflow automatically varies the approach:

| # | Angle | Hook Style |
|---|-------|------------|
| 1 | Problem-solution | Opens with a question |
| 2 | Myth-busting | Opens with controversial statement |
| 3 | Quick-tip | Opens with a number/statistic |
| 4 | Before-after | Opens with transformation |
| 5 | Trend-commentary | Opens with news/timely angle |

## MCP Integration (Optional)

This workflow can also be exposed to Claude Desktop via n8n's Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, allowing you to generate videos through natural language prompts.

### To enable MCP:

1. Add a **Webhook Trigger** node to the workflow (in addition to the Manual Trigger)
2. Connect it to the same **⚙️ Workflow Configuration** node
3. Go to **Settings** → **Instance-level MCP** → Enable the workflow
4. Configure Claude Desktop with your n8n MCP server URL

### Claude Desktop Configuration (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n-mcp": {
      "command": "supergateway",
      "args": [
        "--streamableHttp",
        "https://YOUR_N8N_INSTANCE.app.n8n.cloud/mcp-server/http",
        "--header",
        "authorization:Bearer YOUR_MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

&gt; **Note**: Install `supergateway` globally first: `npm install -g supergateway`

---

## Limitations & Notes

### Technical Limitations

- **tmpfiles.org**: Temporary file URLs expire after ~1 hour. Final videos are safe in Google Drive.
- **VEED processing**: Takes 2-5 minutes per video depending on length.
- **n8n Cloud network**: Some external domains are blocked; workflow uses base64 for images to avoid this.

### Content Considerations

- Scripts are optimized for 30-45 seconds (TTS-friendly)
- Avatar images are AI-generated (not real people)
- Captions include hashtags automatically
- Each video in a batch gets a different content angle

### Best Practices

1. **Start small**: Test with 1 video before scaling to 5
2. **Review scripts**: Claude generates good content but review before posting
3. **Monitor costs**: Check API usage dashboards weekly
4. **Backup sheets**: The Google Sheet serves as your content database

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Organization must be verified" | Verify at platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general |
| VEED authentication error | Re-add FAL.ai credential to VEED node |
| Google Drive "no binary field" | Ensure Download Video outputs to field named `data` |
| JSON parse error from Claude | Workflow has fallback content; check Claude node output |
| Image URL blocked | Workflow uses base64 to avoid this; ensure gpt-image-1 model |
| MCP "Server disconnected" (Windows) | Install supergateway globally: `npm install -g supergateway` |
| MCP path error on Windows | Use `supergateway` directly instead of `npx` |
